# project


So basically i am a sole trader (electrician), been self employed for 10 years now, after the first year of yellow pages rinsing me for a crappy one page website i 
started learning how to build websites, so i have been tinkering for few years, built several sites now including my company site, i really enjoy it.

Anyway every year i have to sort my books for my accountant, which is a pain, i started using a ledger, as it was what i thought was needed, 
then after getting fed up with writing it all out i decided to create a form on word, it was ok, it saved on writing, it looked neater, and could correct any mistakes easier.

Then i was looking for something meaningful to build to help me with learning javascript, so i designed an accounting form as a webpage which does all the calcultating
and has input boxes and various inputs to speed up the process, its really good so i kept going, adding more features, and adding more forms designing more pages,
then i built some forms to help me as an electrician, integrated them into my website, so now i can logon when im onsite and complete a certificate from my phone,
one click and it saves it to pdf as an A4 certificate with my company logo and details, i just kept going, invoice template, proposal template, Max Zs calculator, all
usable from any device and printable pages come out as A4 with my logo and details on. Its great, saves me a tonne of time and comes out looking great.

That gave me an idea, as i had the bug and wanted to continue building, its a great way to learn if you have a good project to crack on with,
so i started creating a website to contain all the same forms but without my logos, and its coming along, bare in mind im doing it all my self while working most days,
so its been about 6 months so far, and im at the point where im trying to add a pay wall for the good stuff, iv hit a pay wall alright!.... not done much php, but the
paypal integration has had me stuck for the last month going round and round in circles. normally i can see the problem and figure out the solution, but this is really
the strangest bit of coding i have come accross to date..... even the snippets direct from paypal only works SOME of the time, without me changing any code it will work 
a couple of times, then it wont work for a few tries, then it works again!... Is this something on paypals side maybe, i dont know, they dont reply. people on youtube 
show how to create a plan and product, iv done that, thats easy.. its the next part, no documentation to help with it, paypals docs are shit, im at a loss right now,
im continuing to design other parts of the site because i know i will figure it out eventually. Any help would be much appriciated.
 
 Steve.
